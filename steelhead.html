                    <p>The radar chart displays the total Steelhead catch counts by month for the year 2023. It is a circular graph where each axis represents one of the twelve months of the year, starting from January at the top and progressing clockwise. The data points on the chart are connected by a blue line, and the area under this line is filled with a translucent blue color, indicating the catch counts for each month. The further the line is from the center, the more fish were caught.</p>
                    <p>An interesting takeaway is there is not two steelhead seasons, Winter and Summer. There's a major winter season and a miniscule spike in July. If you want to avoid getting skunked, focus on fishing for steelhead in winter.</p>

                    <p>The choropleth map displayed illustrates the distribution of fish catch counts across different counties in Oregon. The map uses varying shades of green to represent different levels of fish catch counts, with darker shades indicating higher catch counts.</p>
                    <p>Focus on fishing at waterbodies that are located in darker counties for the best chance of catching fish.</p>
